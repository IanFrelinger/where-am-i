## üöÄ Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Playwright browsers** (first time only):
   ```bash
   pnpm test:playwright:install
   # or
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. **Ensure the application is deployed** and accessible at the configured base URL

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests on all browsers
pnpm test:playwright

# Run specific test categories
pnpm test:playwright:smoke      # Smoke tests only
pnpm test:playwright:map        # Map tests only
pnpm test:playwright:e2e        # E2E tests only
pnpm test:playwright:quick      # Smoke + Map tests

# Interactive testing
pnpm test:playwright:ui         # Open Playwright UI
pnpm test:playwright:debug      # Debug mode (headed)
pnpm test:playwright:headed     # Run tests in headed mode
```

### Using the Test Runner Script

```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x tests/run-tests.sh

# Run different test configurations
./tests/run-tests.sh                    # All tests on all browsers
./tests/run-tests.sh smoke              # Smoke tests only
./tests/run-tests.sh map                # Map tests only
./tests/run-tests.sh e2e                # E2E tests only
./tests/run-tests.sh quick              # Quick test suite
./tests/run-tests.sh browser firefox    # All tests on Firefox
./tests/run-tests.sh parallel           # All tests in parallel
./tests/run-tests.sh debug              # Debug mode
./tests/run-tests.sh ui                 # Open Playwright UI
./tests/run-tests.sh help               # Show help
```

### Direct Playwright Commands

```bash
# Run specific test files
npx playwright test tests/smoke.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/map.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e.spec.ts

# Run on specific browsers
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit

# Run with specific reporters
npx playwright test --reporter=html,line
npx playwright test --reporter=json
npx playwright test --reporter=junit

# Run with specific workers
npx playwright test --workers=1          # Sequential execution
npx playwright test --workers=4          # Parallel execution
```

## üîß Configuration

### Playwright Config (`playwright.config.ts`)

- **Base URL**: `https://d1pxtwdttqrk2p.cloudfront.net`
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- **Headless Mode**: Enabled by default (faster execution)
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled by default
- **Retries**: 2 on CI, 0 locally
- **Screenshots**: On failure only

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Run tests against different environments
BASE_URL=https://localhost:3000 pnpm test:playwright
BASE_URL=https://staging.example.com pnpm test:playwright
BASE_URL=https://production.example.com pnpm test:playwright
```

## üêõ Debugging Tests

### Running Modes

#### Headless Mode (Default)
```bash
# Run tests in headless mode (faster, no browser UI)
pnpm test:playwright
# or
npx playwright test
```

#### Headed Mode
```bash
# Run tests with visible browser
pnpm test:playwright:headed
# or
npx playwright test --headed
```

#### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run tests in debug mode (headed with debugging tools)
pnpm test:playwright:debug
# or
npx playwright test --debug
```

### Playwright UI

```bash
# Open interactive UI
pnpm test:playwright:ui
# or
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Use `page.pause()`** in test code to pause execution
2. **Check console logs** for detailed error information
3. **Review screenshots and videos** for visual debugging
4. **Use `--headed` flag** to see browser during test execution
5. **Enable traces** for detailed execution flow

## üì± Browser Support

- **Chromium**: Full support, primary testing browser
- **Firefox**: Full support, secondary testing browser
- **WebKit**: Full support, Safari compatibility

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Map Not Loading
- Verify CloudFront distribution is accessible
- Check that CSS and JavaScript assets are loading
- Ensure Mapbox GL JS is properly initialized

### Test Failures
- Check network connectivity to the application
- Verify the application is deployed and running
- Review console errors and network requests
- Check viewport sizes and responsive behavior

### Performance Issues
- Reduce parallel workers: `--workers=1`
- Increase timeouts for slow operations
- Use specific browser projects instead of all browsers

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
- name: Run Playwright Tests
  run: |
    pnpm test:playwright:install
    pnpm test:playwright --reporter=junit
  env:
    BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.BASE_URL }}
```

### CI/CD Integration

- **JUnit Reports**: `test-results/results.xml`
- **JSON Results**: `test-results/results.json`
- **Artifacts**: Screenshots, videos, traces
- **Exit Codes**: Proper failure reporting
